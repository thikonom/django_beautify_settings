A tiny script that removes all the ( unnecessary ) comments from django's settings.py
and renders content in a pretty format.

Use it like this:

1) Provide the path of settings.py from command line:  python clean_settings.py /Users/username/django-project/settings.py

2) Place the script on the root of your django project: python clean_settings.py
